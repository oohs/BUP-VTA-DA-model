Morphine is a common prescription painkiller that impacts several brain regions; when abused, it can lead to tolerance, dependence, and addiction. A crucial step in treating patients suffering from morphine addiction is overcoming withdrawal, a series of physical and mental symptoms that occur after stopping the use of an addictive drug. Opioid agonists, which bind to opioid receptors, can be used to treat addiction by inducing effects similar to those of morphine, but over a much longer period to eliminate cravings. Buprenorphine (BUP) is one of the safest and most frequently used agonists for treating opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, few computational models exist that simulate its influence on the brain. Our objective was to create a computational model simulating the impact of BUP on the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region in the midbrain responsible for dopamine production, reward pathways, and addiction. We simulated the effects of BUP on the firing rates and dopamine release of a single VTA dopamine (DA) neuron undergoing morphine withdrawal. We modeled the impact of the agonist during withdrawal by modifying conductances of the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate in the simulation and contrasted this to a control neuron without these modifications. Our simulation findings provide an insight into the specific effects BUP has on dopamine discharge patterns and the firing rates of VTA DA neurons. These results could potentially lead to developments in the field of opioid addiction treatment and help decipher the most effective method of treatment.
